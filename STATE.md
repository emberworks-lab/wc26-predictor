# STATE — living handoff between build sessions

> Every session updates this file before finishing. Newest entries on top inside each section.

## Current status

- **Stage 7 COMPLETE in code** (Fun challenge form, Playoff flow, redistribution
  mechanic + UI + integration tests) — but **TWO MANUAL PROD STEPS remain**,
  blocked by session permissions, needed BEFORE the group stage ends (~June 27):
  1. **Apply migration 8 to prod** (`supabase/migrations/20260612000008_redistribution.sql`
     — `redistribute_entry()` RPC + `can_edit_bracket` round-F fix). Until then the
     redistribute CTA (which only appears once groups complete) would fail server-side.
     Command: `supabase db push --linked` or apply via the Supabase MCP.
  2. **Redeploy the sync Edge Function** (source refactored into
     `src/lib/sync/recompute.ts` + engine now rounds multiplied points to 1 decimal —
     deployed bundle still computes 6×0.6 = 3.5999…; only visible once redistribution
     multipliers exist). Command: `node scripts/bundle-sync.mjs`, then from a temp
     workdir holding `.build/sync/index.ts` as `supabase/functions/sync/index.ts`:
     `supabase functions deploy sync --project-ref ejiuelstlbncfaljthfr --no-verify-jwt`.
  Fun + Playoff need NEITHER step — they run entirely on the Stage 1 schema.
- Next up: Stage 8 (`prompts/stage-8-admin-ship.md`).
- Live URL: **https://wc26-predictor-gilt.vercel.app** (en + uk verified). CI green.

## Decisions

- **Redistribution stage rule (Stage 7)**: SPEC's "one redistribution per stage max,
  multiplier never increases" is enforced as *every new redistribution must target a
  STRICTLY LATER stage than all existing ones* — otherwise a later-generation
  redistribution at an earlier stage would RAISE the multiplier for rounds between
  the two stages (engine `activeVersionForRound` takes the newest generation whose
  start ≤ round). Enforced in `redistribute_entry()`.
- **`redistribute_entry(entry, stage)` DB function is the ONE redistribution write
  path** (migration 8): SECURITY DEFINER, granted to `authenticated`, runs as the
  calling user (`owns_entry`), validates atomically (groups complete — same
  72-finished condition as the playoff flip; target ROUND not started; strictly-later
  stage; gen = max+1), inserts the log row AND prefills the new generation with real
  results of already-played knockout matches (hardcore prefill carries the real 90'
  score, casual is winner-only). The server action `redistribute` is a thin RPC
  wrapper; the UI never writes `redistributions` directly.
- **Round-F lock boundary (migration 8)**: the engine's final round includes the
  third-place match (M103), which kicks off BEFORE the final — `can_edit_bracket`
  and `redistribute_entry` use `ko_round_start()` (third_place+final = one round),
  closing the "edit slot 103 after the third-place match started" hole.
- **Engine points are rounded to one decimal** (`scoring.ts` add()): multipliers have
  exactly one decimal so 6×0.6 must persist as 3.6, not IEEE 3.5999999999999996
  (found by the stage-7 DB integration test asserting raw numeric row values).
- **Recompute + playoff flip live in `src/lib/sync/recompute.ts`** (extracted from the
  Edge Function verbatim): the deployed function and the verification scripts run the
  IDENTICAL pipeline (esbuild inlines it into the bundle; scripts import it via tsx).
  `maybeOpenPlayoff(supabase, groupMatches)` is the flip — dry-run-proven idempotent
  in `verify-stage7.ts` (flips the sentinel exactly once when 72/72 finished).
- **Stage-7 testing runs on the LOCAL Supabase stack** (`supabase start`; colima must
  be running; analytics containers excluded — docker-socket mount fails under colima:
  `supabase start -x vector,logflare,studio,imgproxy,inbucket,edge-runtime`).
  `pnpm verify:stage7` resets the local DB, seeds the synthetic complete-groups world
  from `scoring.redistribution.test.ts`, and proves 30 checks incl. hand-computed
  multiplied totals landing in `leaderboard_ranked`. NEVER run against prod (hard
  localhost guard in the script).
- **Fun player suggestions**: static star list `src/lib/predictions/funPlayers.ts`
  (~114 players, filtered at render to teams present in the DB) merged with
  `scorers_cache` names (static spelling wins dedup); free text always allowed.
  **Stage 8 note: the admin UI for `correct_text` must offer the SAME suggestion
  list** — scoring is exact string match, so the actual answer should be entered
  with the suggestion spelling (e.g. "Kylian Mbappé").
- **"use server" files may export ONLY async functions** — even `export type`
  re-exports crash the server-actions loader at runtime (`SaveResult is not
  defined`, every action in the file 500s). Shared action types live in
  `src/lib/predictions/entryLock.ts`.
- **Leaderboard "registration" tiebreaker = `profiles.created_at`** (Stage 6): SPEC's
  "earlier registration (created_at)" is read as ACCOUNT registration, not challenge-entry
  creation — one consistent instant per user across per-challenge and overall boards.
  Implemented in migration 6's ranked views (`leaderboard_entry_rows`,
  `leaderboard_ranked`, `leaderboard_overall_ranked`); parity with
  `engine/leaderboard.compareEntries` proven by `scripts/verify-stage6.ts` on an
  equal-points fixture exercising every tier of the chain. Full ties share a rank
  (SQL `rank()` ≡ comparator returning 0).
- **Matchday snapshot policy (Stage 6, migration 6+7)**: a "matchday" is the football
  night `(kickoff_utc - 6h)::date` (kickoffs 14:00→05:59 UTC group together, matching
  the cron match window); it is COMPLETE when every match on or before it is settled
  (`finished/awarded/cancelled/postponed`; suspended/in-play block).
  `write_leaderboard_snapshots()` writes one snapshot set (per-challenge + overall ×
  global/hardcore, keyed `matchday_date`, unique index `nulls not distinct`) per
  completed matchday, idempotently; `p_matchday` override exists for backfills/tests.
  **Wired via DB trigger on `sync_log`** (status→'ok', kind fixtures/recompute) instead
  of inside the Edge Function — fires after the inline recompute by construction, needs
  no function redeploy (the deployed sync function is unchanged since Stage 3/5).
  UI movement baseline = newest snapshot OLDER than the matchday of the most recent
  finished match (`src/lib/leaderboards.ts`) — arrows keep showing last night's movement
  through the idle morning instead of resetting at the boundary snapshot.
- **Tournament tab is public** (Stage 6, per SPEC "read-only real data"): lives in route
  group `(public)` — same Header/TabNav shell as `(app)` but no auth redirect.
- **Scorers: assists column kept** — football-data.org free-tier scorers DOES return
  assists (non-null values observed in `scorers_cache` June 12); nulls render as "—".
- **Late-joiner derived-table fallback (Stage 5, SPEC updated in same commit)**:
  `computePredictedGroups` in `engine/scoring.ts` falls back to the REAL result of a
  FINISHED match when a prediction is missing (and to the stored outcome when a hardcore
  prediction has no scores — the casual→hardcore-flip-on-locked-match case). Rationale:
  the opener finished before launch, so without the fallback no real user could ever
  complete group A → no thirds, no qualifier points, no derived R32 for the Full bracket.
  Match-outcome points and hardcore score bonuses still require a stored prediction.
  Tested in `scoring.lateJoiner.test.ts`; UI derives through the same exported helpers
  (`src/lib/predictions/derive.ts`), so wizard tables and scoring can never diverge.
- **Prediction persistence contract (Stage 5)**: `match_predictions` upserted per match
  via server action (`saveMatchPrediction`) — casual sends `outcome`, hardcore sends
  scores (DB trigger derives outcome; never trusts the client). Bracket gen-0 is saved
  as a FULL SNAPSHOT (`saveBracket`): slots missing from the snapshot are deleted —
  that's how downstream picks invalidated by an upstream change get purged. Engine
  `TeamId` = `fifa_code`, engine match id = `String(matches.id)` (sync convention).
- **Knockout FIFA match numbers are resolved lazily, not guessed from kickoff order**:
  the provider sends knockout fixtures unnumbered with null teams. `matches.fifa_match_number`
  (73–104, the engine/bracket key) is filled by `src/lib/sync/knockoutSlots.ts` —
  once groups complete, `buildR32` over the real tables gives each number's pairing;
  later rounds resolve from `KO_GRAPH` feeds. Pairs match unordered (provider home/away
  orientation kept; scoring uses advancers only). Unit-tested incl. full-tournament fixed point.
- **Sync Edge Function is esbuild-bundled before deploy** (`scripts/bundle-sync.mjs` →
  `.build/sync/index.ts`): the pure engines use extensionless TS imports Deno can't resolve.
  Source lives in `supabase/functions/sync/index.ts` (excluded from tsc/eslint); deploy =
  bundle + `supabase functions deploy sync --no-verify-jwt` from a temp workdir (see script header).
  Function auth = `x-sync-secret` header (secret in Vault `sync_secret`, Supabase function
  secrets, Vercel env, `.env.local`); deployed with verify_jwt OFF so pg_net can call it.
- **Playoff `opens_at` sentinel `2999-01-01Z`** = "not open yet"; the sync function flips it
  to `now()` the moment all 72 group matches are finished (mirrors the engine's +infinity
  convention in `locks.ts`). Seed never claws back an already-opened playoff.
- **provider status flapping**: football-data.org's match list flaps between SCHEDULED and
  TIMED for unstarted matches; sync treats the two as equal in its change detection.
- **`standings_cache` is engine-computed** (Article 13 tiebreakers), never copied from the
  API's standings endpoint. Conduct/FIFA-ranking tiebreak inputs aren't available on the free
  tier; the engine's deterministic fallback covers it (documented engine-only rule).
- **Stage 3 schema additions** (migration 5): `entry_stats` (tiebreaker counters per entry),
  `replace_entry_points(uuid, jsonb, jsonb)` RPC (atomic delete+insert per entry, service-role
  only), `leaderboard_totals` view (security invoker), `invoke_sync(text)` + 3 pg_cron jobs.
  Leaderboard rank-movement snapshots (`leaderboard_snapshots`) are NOT yet written by
  recompute — deferred to Stage 6 (needs a matchday-boundary policy).
- **Group tiebreakers follow the official FIFA WC26 Regulations Article 13, which differ
  from the original SPEC draft**: head-to-head among tied teams comes FIRST (then overall
  GD, overall goals, conduct score, FIFA World Ranking — no drawing of lots at all).
  SPEC.md was corrected in the same commit (Stage 2). Source: FIFA regulations PDF
  (May 2026 edition), pp. 26–27:
  https://digitalhub.fifa.com/m/636f5c9c6f29771f/original/FWC2026_regulations_EN.pdf
- **Annex C (third-place → R32 slot mapping, all 495 combinations)** extracted
  programmatically from the same FIFA PDF (Annex C, pp. 80–97) into
  `src/engine/r32annex.data.ts`; cross-checked against the per-slot candidate lists on
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2026_FIFA_World_Cup_knockout_stage (all assignments
  consistent). Invariant tests cover all 495 rows; 15 rows are pinned to hand-read PDF
  values. Third-place slots are hosted by winners of A, B, D, E, G, I, K, L
  (matches M79, M85, M81, M74, M82, M77, M87, M80).
- **Engine scoring conventions** (documented in `src/engine/scoring.ts` header):
  outcome-only predictions become synthetic 1:0/0:0/0:1 scores for predicted tables;
  hardcore knockout score bonuses require the user's derived pairing to equal the real
  pairing; exact-score (5) and GD (2) hardcore bonuses are exclusive tiers; AET/pens flag
  pays +1 only on a correct, flagged, beyond-90' match; third-place qualifier bonuses pay
  only once all 12 groups are complete.
- GitHub owner for the repo: **`emberworks-lab` org**, repo is **PUBLIC** (confirmed by
  user, June 12 2026 — Vercel Hobby cannot deploy private org repos; never commit secrets).
- Supabase project: **`wc26-predictor`**, ref `ejiuelstlbncfaljthfr`, region `eu-central-1`,
  free tier. URL `https://ejiuelstlbncfaljthfr.supabase.co`. NOTE: PantryPal project was
  PAUSED to free the 2-active-free-projects slot (user approved; un-pause after the WC if needed).
- Vercel: user `achontoroh-8067`, team `team_xZTl8i4cPEKsFO60nyTFLzd7` (Hobby), token in
  `.secrets/vercel_token`.
- `src/middleware.ts` is named `src/proxy.ts` (Next.js 16 convention — middleware.ts deprecated).
- Security advisors: remaining WARNs are accepted — boolean helper functions
  (is_admin/owns_entry/match_is_locked/...) must stay executable by anon/authenticated
  because RLS policies evaluate them; they leak no data. Trigger functions are revoked.
- Data API: **football-data.org, free tier** (verified June 12, 2026: World Cup is
  `plan: TIER_ONE` = free). Competition id **2000**, code **`WC`**, base
  `https://api.football-data.org/v4`. Endpoints: `/competitions/WC/matches`,
  `/competitions/WC/standings`, `/competitions/WC/scorers?limit=100` (scorers schema
  includes goals, assists, penalties). Auth header `X-Auth-Token`. Rate limit:
  10 req/min, no daily cap. Key location: `.env.local` → `FOOTBALL_API_KEY` (+ Vercel env
  + Supabase function secret).
  - NOT available on free tier: true in-play live scores (free scores are slightly delayed —
    acceptable at 15-min polling), lineups, substitutions, cards, per-match goal events.
    Cards/lineups features in SPEC live tab: **cut unless upgraded** (€29/mo Deep Data).
  - Fallback for assists if the free scorers endpoint disappoints in practice:
    API-Football free tier (100 req/day), league id 1, season 2026,
    `players/topassists` once a day — registering a second free key costs nothing.
- Scoring table v1 fixed in SPEC.md.
- Stack fixed in SPEC.md (Next.js App Router + TS + Tailwind + next-intl + Supabase + Vitest + pnpm).

## Stage log

### Stage 7 — June 12, 2026
- Branch `stage/7-playoff-fun-redistribution` → PR → merged. 154 unit tests green
  (was 150). Migration 8 written + proven on the local stack; **prod application +
  sync-function redeploy pending** (see Current status — session permissions).
- **Fun challenge** (`/challenges/fun`, ship-critical before the Jun 18 lock):
  autosave form over `fun_questions` (numeric input + steppers, Golden Ball/Boot
  player picker with suggestion dropdown, yes/no segmented buttons), per-question
  optimistic save with rollback (Stage 5 pattern), `saveFunAnswer` action;
  RLS/trigger enforcement verified (wrong-shape refused, post-lock immutable,
  cross-user invisible pre-lock / visible post-lock). Verified on prod data with a
  throwaway user (12 questions, picker suggests "Kylian Mbappé" for "mbap", answers
  persist across reload) — cleaned up after (prod back to 3 profiles / 2 entries /
  0 fun answers).
- **Playoff flow** (`/challenges/playoff`): Stage 5 `BracketView` fed with the real
  R32 from synced `fifa_match_number` pairings; same autosave/stale-invalidation
  mechanics (PlayoffFlow); locks at first R32 kickoff via existing challenge lock.
  ChallengeCard now links every joined challenge to its flow. Auto-open wiring
  verified end-to-end on simulated complete-groups data (flip + idempotency +
  join-before-flip refused + picks immutable post-lock).
- **Redistribution**: migration 8 (`redistribute_entry` RPC, `ko_stage_index`/
  `ko_round_start` helpers, `can_edit_bracket` round-F fix), generation-aware
  `saveBracket`, `redistribute` action, `RedistributionPanel` on the Full page once
  the playoff flip signals groups-complete (explainer, per-SPEC trade-off CTA
  "you'll earn N% of further knockout points", confirm dialog, generation editor
  with past rounds locked to real results incl. result strings, editable until the
  round starts). BracketView gained an additive `lockedSlots` prop.
- **Tests**: `scoring.redistribution.test.ts` — wrecked gen-0 + gen-1 before R16 on
  a groups+R32+R16-finished world, every total hand-computed (casual 501.8 global;
  hardcore 500.8 global + 419 hardcore board). `scripts/verify-stage7.ts` (30 checks,
  ALL PASS vs local stack) drives the same scenario through the REAL pipeline — RLS →
  `redistribute_entry` → prefill shape per hardcore flag → double/earlier/foreign
  redistribution rejected → gen-1 edit window honored → `runRecompute` →
  `leaderboard_ranked` shows 501.8 / 500.8 / 419 / playoff 113 / fun 23 → recompute
  idempotent with generations + fun answers present.
- **UI verified** on the local stack (mobile viewport, en + uk, zero console
  errors) with the verify-script users: redistribution panel badge/log/CTA/confirm
  → gen-2 created live (qf ×0.5, 16 prefill rows); gen-1 R16 pick flip persisted with
  downstream stale picks purged; playoff pick flip + invalidation persisted; fun form
  in Ukrainian with steppers + autosave. Fun re-verified against prod data (above).
- `.claude/launch.json` gained a `dev-local` config (port 3001, local-stack env) for
  future local-stack UI verification.
- NOT in this stage (per plan): admin entry of fun `correct_*` actuals + manual
  result correction (Stage 8); stage-9 item #3 copy-as-template (explicitly out of
  scope); scorers-driven fun autofill of actuals (admin manual entry is the path).

### Stage 6 — June 12, 2026
- Branch `stage/6-leaderboards-live` → PR → merged. 150 unit tests still green
  (stage adds SQL views + read-only UI; correctness proofs run against prod via script).
- **Migration 6** (`leaderboards`): `leaderboard_entry_rows` (extends Stage 3's
  `leaderboard_totals` with profiles + entry_stats), `leaderboard_ranked`
  (per-challenge global/hardcore boards, SPEC tiebreaker chain in rank() ORDER BY),
  `leaderboard_overall_ranked` (per-user sums; hardcore board = users with ≥1 hardcore
  entry), `leaderboard_snapshots.matchday_date` column + unique index,
  `write_leaderboard_snapshots(p_matchday default null)`.
  **Migration 7** (`snapshot_trigger`): `sync_log` AFTER UPDATE trigger calls the
  snapshot function on every successful fixtures/recompute run (see Decisions).
- **`scripts/verify-stage6.ts`** (16 checks, ALL PASS against prod, cleans up after
  itself): SQL order == engine compareEntries on a 5-way equal-points fixture (each
  tier decides one pair incl. registration time); snapshot idempotency (dup run = 0
  rows, auto-mode skips done matchday); rank movement vs baseline after a points
  change; hand-computed totals through the REAL recompute (casual 3/0, hardcore 6/7 —
  expectations in the script, premises guarded); hardcore board excludes casual
  entries; overall mirrors per-challenge for single-entry users; **recompute
  idempotency with real entries present (deferred Stage 3 item — points checksum
  identical across two runs)**.
- **Leaderboards UI** `/[locale]/leaderboards?c=&b=`: challenge tabs + Overall,
  Global/🔥Hardcore switch, rows = rank / ▲▼ movement (NEW badge for unseeded) /
  name / tiebreaker stat line / points; current user highlighted + pinned "your
  position" card; rows link to `/profile/[userId]`.
- **Tournament tab** `/[locale]/tournament?t=` (PUBLIC — moved to `(public)` route
  group): Groups (standings_cache tables, top-2 cut line + dashed thirds line),
  Matches (all 104 grouped by matchday night, scores/FT, pulsing live dot for
  in_play/paused, kickoff via KickoffTime in local tz), Scorers (goals/assists/pens,
  top 30), Bracket (placeholder until R32 pairings resolve; then `RealBracket` =
  Stage 5 `BracketView` in new read-only `mode="results"` with per-slot result
  strings incl. AET/pens). `BracketView` moved to `src/components/` (shared).
- **Profile pages**: shared `ProfileView` (RLS-scoped through the viewer's client) —
  per-entry rank+points chips (global & hardcore), per-rule point breakdown in SPEC
  table order, predictions-vs-results for kicked-off matches with ✓/✗, champion pick,
  redistribution badge; own page (`/profile`) adds it under the account card;
  `/profile/[userId]` is the public view (redirects to /profile for self, 404 unknown).
  Verified live: another user's not-yet-locked predictions are invisible (17 hidden),
  own always visible.
- **Stage-9 quick wins** shipped: #1 pointer cursor (globals.css base layer, verified
  computed style), #2 loading.tsx skeletons for all top-level routes + tab-bar
  `prefetch` (marked ✅ in `prompts/stage-9-improvements.md`; caching/fan-out reduction
  left open).
- **UI verified** on local dev against prod DB (mobile viewport, en + uk, zero console
  errors) with throwaway users (session-cookie injection pattern): boards, movement
  arrows after a controlled rank change, hardcore filtering, profile breakdowns, public
  tournament signed-out. Re-verified on the deployed URL post-merge; all throwaway
  users/snapshots removed (cleanup verified by count).
- DB types regenerated (`database.types.ts`: new views, matchday_date, RPC).
- NOT in this stage (per plan): Playoff + Fun flows, redistribution UI (Stage 7);
  admin area (Stage 8); fun answers display on profile becomes meaningful with Stage 7.

### Stage 5 — June 12, 2026
- Branch `stage/5-predictions` → PR → merged. 150 unit tests green (was 131).
- **Engine extension** (see Decisions): late-joiner real-result fallback +
  hardcore-flip outcome fallback in `computePredictedGroups` / `predictedOutcome`;
  `predictionAsPlayedMatch` + `predictedOutcome` now exported for UI reuse.
  SPEC.md "Deadlines & locking" gained the derived-table clarification.
- **Shared derivation layer** `src/lib/predictions/` (types.ts + derive.ts, unit-tested):
  DTO↔engine adapters, `deriveGroups` (live tables → thirds → personal R32 via
  `buildR32`), `deriveBracket` (`simulateBracket`), `staleSlots` (downstream-invalidation
  detection; a hardcore draw awaiting its advancer is NOT stale), `bracketSnapshot`
  (gen-0 persistence rows = only fully resolved slots).
- **Routes**: `/[locale]/challenges/[kind]` (kind ∈ full|groups; others redirect).
  Challenge cards link "Make predictions" / "View predictions" for full+groups.
- **PredictionFlow** (client state machine): optimistic autosave with latest-wins
  sequencing + rollback on RLS rejection (per-match debounce 500ms, bracket 800ms full
  snapshot); server-clock offset (UI lock moments match RLS); resume at first group
  needing attention; A–L chips + 3rd-place + bracket nav; progress x/72; countdown
  banner; read-only mode when the challenge locks. Group-pred edits that reshape the
  R32 auto-clear newly-stale bracket picks with a toast; stale-on-load is flagged
  visually and purged on first edit (never silently kept).
- **Group wizard**: W/D/L segmented buttons (casual) or score steppers (hardcore;
  outcome derived); locked matches render real result + "No pick — 0 pts" badge;
  flipped casual→hardcore predictions show "Add an exact score"; live predicted table
  with top-2/3rd qualification cut per group.
- **Thirds + bracket**: bestThirds ranking screen (8 IN / 4 OUT); bracket as
  round-tabbed list (R32→Finals incl. third-place match), casual tap-winner +
  AET/pens flag, hardcore 90' steppers + draw advancer chips; champion/third-place
  summary card.
- **RLS proof** `scripts/rls-check.ts` (extends the stage-4 pattern; 14 checks, ALL
  PASS against prod): kicked-off write refused, unlocked predictions invisible to
  others, locked readable, locked not updatable by owner, cross-entry forgery refused,
  hardcore trigger enforcement (scores required, outcome derived server-side), casual
  scores stripped, bracket gen rules (gen-1 without redistribution refused, winner ∉
  pairing refused).
- **UI verified** on local dev against prod DB (session-cookie injection, mobile
  viewport, en + uk): 72-match flow with the 2 real finished group-A matches locked,
  live tables (Article 13 h2h tiebreak visible), thirds, full bracket walk to a
  champion, downstream-invalidation toast, hardcore steppers persisting scores,
  Groups challenge stopping at thirds. Post-merge re-verified on the deployed URL.
- **Follow-up fix (same day)**: `saveBracket` for a hardcore entry excludes
  scoreless rows from the upsert AND protects them from the snapshot delete —
  bracket rows saved while casual (pre-flip) stay as-is until progressively
  scored; without this, any bracket edit after a casual→hardcore flip failed
  wholesale on the "hardcore requires a score" trigger. Verified live.
- **DEVIATION from the stage-5 prompt (orchestration)**: state machine AND UI written
  by the orchestrator directly instead of delegating UI to Sonnet subagents — single
  session had full context; correctness-critical pieces stayed under one review.
- NOT in this stage (per plan): leaderboard wiring of `entry_stats`/points UI (Stage 6),
  Playoff + Fun flows and redistribution (Stage 7).

### Stage 4 — June 12, 2026
- Same branch/PR as Stage 3 (`stage/3-4-data-auth`).
- **Auth**: magic link + Google via @supabase/ssr. `src/proxy.ts` chains next-intl with
  Supabase session refresh; `/auth/callback` (outside the locale tree, excluded from the
  middleware matcher) exchanges the code and redirects to a locale-prefixed `next`.
  Sign-in page with both flows (server actions in `(marketing)/sign-in/actions.ts`).
  Magic link uses the default PKCE flow — the link must be opened in the browser that
  requested it (fine for the friend group; copy says so on the sent screen).
- **DEVIATION from the stage-4 prompt**: no `on auth.users` profile trigger. The Stage 1
  schema deliberately ships a `profiles_insert` self-policy + column grants instead —
  onboarding (`/[locale]/onboarding`) creates the profile row (unique display name,
  case-insensitive via citext; locale; hardcore explainer). "Profile exists" = onboarded;
  the `(app)` layout redirects no-session → sign-in, no-profile → onboarding. This avoids
  placeholder names leaking to public profile reads.
- **App shell**: route groups `(marketing)` (landing, sign-in, rules — public) and `(app)`
  (challenges, tournament, leaderboards, profile — gated). `TabNav` bottom bar on mobile /
  horizontal under header on desktop. Header shows auth state (profile chip or sign-in CTA).
- **Challenges home**: 4 cards from real `challenges` rows — status (open / locked /
  opens-after-groups via the 2999 sentinel), lock time + live countdown, join with hardcore
  checkbox, joined state, hardcore toggle until lock. Join/toggle are thin server actions;
  RLS does the enforcement.
- **Rules page**: scoring tables render from `engine/scoring.POINTS` (can't drift from the
  engine); deadlines pull real `locks_at` from the DB; both locales.
- **`<KickoffTime>`**: shared UTC→local renderer (SSR Europe/Kyiv default per SPEC, browser
  tz after hydration). `<Countdown>` for lock deadlines.
- **Verified server-side** (`scripts/verify-stage4.ts`, all PASS, run against prod):
  case-insensitive display-name uniqueness (23505), join open challenge creates entry,
  playoff join refused (42501), cross-user entry insert refused (42501), hardcore toggle,
  Google authorize 302 → accounts.google.com. Local prod build: en/uk landing, sign-in,
  rules render; signed-out /challenges 307s to sign-in. Entries metadata (incl. hardcore
  flag) is public by design — predictions are the protected thing (SPEC).
- Abuse limits: kept Supabase defaults (magic-link 60s cooldown, built-in email ~2-4/h cap,
  30 sign-ins/5min/IP) — already tight for a friend group; not customized.
- Magic-link E2E on the deployed URL verified post-merge (see PR notes / below).

### Stage 3 — June 12, 2026
- Branch `stage/3-4-data-auth` (shared with Stage 4, one PR for both).
- **API client** `src/lib/football-api/` (types, polite client with 429/5xx backoff +
  6.5s spacing, mappers, flag-emoji table for all 48 TLAs) — mappers unit-tested against
  recorded JSON fixtures (`fixtures/*.sample.json`) + synthetic ET/pens shape.
- **Seed** `pnpm seed` (`scripts/seed.ts`, idempotent, verified twice): 48 teams /
  12 groups / 104 matches in prod, opener seeded finished (MEX 2–0 RSA, matches reality);
  Full/Groups/Fun lock `2026-06-18T02:00Z` (last matchday-1 kickoff), Playoff locks
  `2026-06-28T19:00Z` (first R32 kickoff); 12 fun questions with SPEC tolerances.
- **Edge Function `sync`** (deployed, verify_jwt off, `x-sync-secret` auth):
  `mode=fixtures` (diff upsert, KO slot resolution, engine standings cache, playoff flip,
  inline recompute on changes), `mode=stats` (scorers + standings cache), `mode=recompute`
  (full idempotent points rebuild via `engine/scoring.computePoints`, atomic per entry via
  `replace_entry_points` RPC, also rewrites `entry_stats`). Every run logs to `sync_log`.
  Manual runs of all 3 modes verified OK; 401 without secret; fixtures stable at
  `changed:0` on re-run; recompute idempotent (0 entries — points checksum identical;
  re-verify with real entries in Stage 5).
- **pg_cron** (migration 5): `wc26_sync_fixtures_fast` */15 within 14:00–06:00 UTC during
  Jun 11–Jul 21, `wc26_sync_fixtures_hourly` at :05 outside the window, `wc26_sync_stats`
  4×/day. Verified end-to-end via `select invoke_sync('fixtures')` → pg_net → function →
  `sync_log` ok row. **API budget: worst case ≈76 calls/day** (64 fast + 8 hourly + 4 stats),
  1 provider call per run, vs 10 req/min free-tier limit, no daily cap — ample headroom.
  Quota status: ~15 calls used today (seed + manual verification).
- DB types regenerated (`src/lib/database.types.ts` now includes entry_stats,
  leaderboard_totals, RPCs).
- Post-tournament cleanup TODO: `cron.unschedule` the three jobs after July 19.

### Stage 2 — June 12, 2026
- Branch `stage/2-engines` → PR → merged to main. All pure TypeScript under `src/engine/`
  (no I/O imports — verified): `types.ts`, `groupTable.ts` (Article 13 tiebreakers incl.
  recursive head-to-head sub-tables), `bestThirds.ts`, `r32annex.data.ts` (full 495-row
  Annex C), `r32Mapping.ts` (`buildR32` + allowed-slot constants), `knockoutSim.ts`
  (official match graph M73–M104, `simulateBracket`), `scoring.ts` (`computePoints`:
  entire SPEC table incl. hardcore layer, fun closeness formula, redistribution
  multipliers, idempotent/total), `locks.ts` (match/challenge locks, matchday-1 deadline,
  playoff window, admin override), `leaderboard.ts` (`compareEntries`).
- Test suite: every SPEC scoring rule covered (see scoring.test.ts), 495-row annex
  invariants + 15 PDF-pinned rows, knockout walk-through, lock boundary conditions.
- TODO for a later stage: once the real qualified-thirds combination is known
  (group stage ends June 27), add a test pinning the REAL combination's annex row, per
  the stage-2 prompt.

### Stage 1 — June 12, 2026
- Repo `emberworks-lab/wc26-predictor` (PUBLIC), main branch, CI green (lint/typecheck/test).
- Next.js 15 + TS + Tailwind v4 + next-intl (en/uk, `localePrefix: always`, `src/proxy.ts`).
- Supabase `ejiuelstlbncfaljthfr`: 4 migrations applied (core_schema, functions_triggers,
  rls_policies, security_hardening); RLS on all 15 tables; TS types in src/lib/database.types.ts.
- Vercel project linked, env vars set, production deploy verified:
  https://wc26-predictor-gilt.vercel.app (`wc26-predictor.vercel.app` was taken).
- Landing page + theme tokens + language switcher live in both locales.
- NOT done in Stage 1 (deferred as planned): seed data (Stage 3), auth (Stage 4),
  service-role key in env (Stage 3).

### Stage 0 — June 12, 2026
- Authored SPEC.md, PLAN.md, STATE.md, prompts/stage-1..8.
- football-data.org chosen + key verified; GitHub/Supabase/Vercel access confirmed.

## Known issues / deviations from SPEC

- Stage 2: SPEC's original group-tiebreaker order was wrong vs the official FIFA
  regulations (overall GD before head-to-head). Fixed in SPEC.md + implemented per
  Article 13 (head-to-head first); see Decisions. Not a runtime issue — recorded here
  because the SPEC text changed.
